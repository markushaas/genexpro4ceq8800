# This is a {TAB} separated list of CEQ8800 run IDs and the amount of RNA which
# was used to prepare the respective samples. The CEQ8800 run IDs have to be
# identical to the name of the respective run files but without extension. If
# the exported file (see README for more information) for example has the file
# name ``MYDATA.txt'' the CEQ8800 run ID would be ``MYDATA''. Please check that
# each ID is unique. The amount of RNA has to be entered in ng. Only figures and
# at most one ``.'' as decimal point are allowed.
